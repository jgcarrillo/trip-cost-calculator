# BASIC COSTS CALCULATOR

This is a pet project only for learning purposes. The aim of this code is to learn the basics about HTML, CSS and (obviously) JS. I made this program in the early times of my web dev path so the code might be a little mess.

### List of features

The list of the features implemented in this program are:

- [x] Basic use of DOM
- [x] Error management
- [x] Use of CSS framework (Bootstrap)
